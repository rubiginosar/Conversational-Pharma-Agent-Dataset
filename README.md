The repository "Conversational-Pharma-Agent-Dataset" contains all the datasets and supporting materials used for performance evaluation of the intent classification strategies tested in the proposed conversational agent framework. It provides access to annotated pharmaceutical dialogues, intent labels, and related resources.


##  Repository Structure

### `/data/raw/`

- `chat_history.json`  
  Logs of user–chatbot interactions.

- `claims.json`  
  Claims generated by the chatbot during user sessions.

- `orders.json`  
  Orders created by the chatbot in response to user requests.

- `tool_logs.jsonl`  
  Logs of internal tool usage by the chatbot.

---

###  `/data/processed/`

- `Data.xlsx` – Contains two sheets:

  - **Sheet1: Product Catalog**  
    ```
    ProductId, Brand, Conditioning, DCI, Dosage, FormId, Imported, PharmacologicalClass, 
    Ppa, ProductClass, ProductName, Psychotropic, Refundable, TherapeuticClass, 
    Thermolabile, SHP, TVA, MaxThreshold
    ```

  - **Sheet2: Order Details**  
    ```
    OrderDate, TotalAmount, ProductId, ProductName, Qty
    ```

- `orderlines_with_status.csv`  
  Order lines enriched with order status:   ProductName, Qty, RefOrderId, TotalAmount, OrderDate, status
  
- `Stage.xlsx` – Intermediate processed data:

- **Sheet1: Claims**  
  ```
  id, category, subcategory, description, created_at
  ```

- **Sheet2: Order Lines (No Status)**  
  ```
  ProductName, Qty, RefOrderId, TotalAmount, OrderDate
  ```

- `eriched_dataset.json`  
A labeled dataset of user–bot interaction pairs used for training or evaluating intent classification models.

##  Use Cases

This dataset supports:

- Benchmarking **intent classification** strategies in pharmaceutical assistant agents.
- Testing **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** workflows on healthcare-related data.
- Fine-tuning or evaluating **LLM agents** for domain-specific tasks such as:
- Product inquiry
- Order management
- Claim processing
