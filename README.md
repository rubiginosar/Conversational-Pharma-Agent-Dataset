##  Repository Structure

### `/data/raw/`

- `chat_history.json`  
  Logs of user–chatbot interactions.

- `claims.json`  
  Claims generated by the chatbot during user sessions.

- `orders.json`  
  Orders created by the chatbot in response to user requests.

- `tool_logs.jsonl`  
  Logs of internal tool usage by the chatbot.

##  Use Cases

This dataset supports:

- Benchmarking **intent classification** strategies in pharmaceutical assistant agents.
- Testing **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** workflows on healthcare-related data.
- Fine-tuning or evaluating **LLM agents** for domain-specific tasks such as:
- Product inquiry
- Order management
- Claim processing
